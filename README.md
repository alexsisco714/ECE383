# USAFA ECE383 (Embedded Systems II) Course Website

Live site: www.ece383.com

Course Director - Capt Todd Branchflower, todd.branchflower@usafa.edu

## Building the Site

The course materials are written in markdown.  To build it, I use a slightly modified markdown parser and some basic templating in conjunction with a build script.  These are written in javascript and run using node.js.  Here is the course-build script: https://github.com/toddbranch/course-build .
