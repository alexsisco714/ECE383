# Lab 5 - Final Project

## Overview

For the final lab, you must propose your own project, develop a sign-off schedule, design / build / test your design, and provide a final report / presentation / video.  Using the skills you have learned, you must create a novel, interesting design.

## Grading Criteria

Your grade will be based on the following criteria:

1. Complexity of your hardware and software design.
2. Quality of your documentation in the final report and presentation.
3. Amount of effort demonstrated in class.
4. Functionality of project based on the deadlines and requirements you set.

## Final Project Hints

Work on something you're passionate about!  So long as it leverages the skills you've learned, any idea is fair game.

- A wide variety of example final projects can be found on Cornell's ECE 5760 course webpage.  Here are a few examples:
  - Implement a simple sprite-based video game.
  - Use double frame-buffering to implement the ability to draw primitive shapes to a VGA screen.
  - Add real-time filtering and effects to an audio or video stream.
  - Interface with a GPS module, magnetometer, accelerometer, etc.
  - Interface with BlueTooth hardware or controllers from popular gaming systems
  - Use an Ethernet cable to communicate useful information between your FPGA and a computer.
- Other courses with good example projects:

- Talk to your instructor if you need a more powerful FPGA.

## Prelab

You have already submitted a project proposal on L21 and received feedback.  Your final proposal and schedule will be signed off by your instructor at the beginning of class based on the following criteria:

- [ ] Final proposal contains adequate general description of the project
- [ ] Final proposal contains appropriate functionality levels and descriptions
- [ ] Student has the requisite hardware for the proposed project
- [ ] Student has developed a reasonable, detailed schedule
- [ ] Student is prepared to begin work

## Final Presentation

Your final presentation should last between 5 to 10 minutes (including demo and Q&A) and must include the following:

- **Introduction** - Provide a brief overview of the problem.  Include the minimum and full functionality requirements.
- **Implementation** - Provide high-level block-diagram of your solution and briefly describe in words how you implemented each the modules.
- **Test/Debug** - Briefly describe the methods used to verify system functionality.  List the major problems you encountered and how you fixed them.
- **Demonstration** - If you had any success with your final project, include a demonstration of your current functionality.
- **Conclusion** - Explain what your learned from this final project and what changes you would recommend in future years to this final project or the lectures leading up to this final project.

## Video

Each student must produce a 30 second video clip showcasing their project - this will be worth 5pts of your final grade.
