# L8 Homework

- [10.7] Can we apply the look-ahead output buffer for Mealy output?  Explain.
- [10.12] Non-return-to-zero (NRZI) code is another code used in serial transmission.  The output of an NRZI encoder is '0' if the current input value is different from the previous value and is '1' otherwise.  Assume the first input and output value is always '0'.  For example, "00000001" would result in "01010100".
  1. Draw the Moore FSM state-transition diagram.
  2. Write the complete VHDL code to implement this NRZI as an FSM.  Use a look-ahead buffer for the output.

## Turn-In Requirements

1. Answers to the above questions.
2. Simulation screenshots and source code where appropriate.
