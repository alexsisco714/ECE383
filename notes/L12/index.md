- Work Time

## Review VGA Lab

Review VGA - problems, good ideas, different ways, etc

So, in capstone, if you're designing an embedded application that needs to drive a large display, should you use an MCU or FPGA?

YOU SHOULD USE AN MCU!!! A more powerful one than the MSP430, but an MCU nonetheless. FPGAs are good for applications that absolutely must be high-speed, low-power. Putting embedded linux on an MCU and using their device driver libraries would be a much better choice both cost and ease-of-development-wise if you wanted to do something like this in CAPSTONE.

## Introduce Pong Lab

Introduce pong

## Work Time

Remainder of time - mod VGA code to be used in pong if necessary
Work on VGA write up, work on pong prelab
