# L7 Homework

1. Consider a counter that counts from `m` to `n` and then wraps around.  Derive VHDL code for the counter.  Use generics, `M` and `N`, for `m` and `n` of the counter.  You may also use a `WIDTH` parameter.  The input signals are `clk`, `reset`, and `en`.  The output signal is `q`.  Write a testbench to test the functionality.
2. Derive a function that converts the `std_logic data` type into the Boolean data type.  The value '1' and 'H' will return true, all other values return false.  Place this function in a package called `helper_functions`.  Write a testbench to verify functionality.
