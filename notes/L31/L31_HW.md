- [11.5] Repetitive-subtraction division is an algorithm to implement division operation.  Let `a` and `b` be the dividend and divisor respectively.  This algorithm obtains the quotient (`q`) and the remainder (`r`) by subtracting `b` from `a` repeatedly until the remaining of `a` is smaller than `b`.  Assume that all signals are 8-bits wide and interpreted as unsigned integers.
  1. Derive a pseudo algorithm.
  2. Convert the pseudo algorithm into an ASMD chart.
  3. Derive a detailed conceptual diagram.
  4. Derive the VHDL code according to the blocks of the conceptual diagram (i.e., in multi-segment style).
  5. Derive the VHDL code in two-segment style.
  6. Is this an efficient algorithm? Explain.
