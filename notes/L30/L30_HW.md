# L30 Homework

- [16.1] Assume that a sequential system with an ideal clock signal can operate at a maximal clock rate of 100 MHz.  If the physical clock distribution network introduces a 1.5-ns clock skew, what is the new maximal clock rate?
- [16.2] Consider a D FF with  and .
  1. If we improve the D FF by reducing  by 10%, discuss the effect on MTBF.
  2. If we improve the D FF by reducing  by 10%, discuss the effect on MTBF.
- [16.4] A two-FF synchronizer is shown in the below diagram.  Determine the new MTBF for below scenarios assuming the following parameters:

  1. The placement and routing process adds a 2.5-ns wiring delay.
  2. The system clock rate is decreased by 10%.
  3. The setup time of the D FF is reduced by 10%.
  4. The  of the D FF is reduced by 10%.
