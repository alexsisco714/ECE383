- Review learning outcomes

## Some Perspective

*[Take roll - use icebreaker questions]*

Welcome to ECE383, now called Embedded Systems II.  First things first - what have you heard about this class?!

Well, what did we learn about last semester?  We learned about **computers** - specifically, _microcontrollers_!

What did we do with them?

- Wrote programs in Assembly Language, then C
- Learned about and used the functional units of a microcontroller
  - SPI
  - Analog-to-Digital
  - PWM
- Used the microcontroller to interface with peripheral devices
  - Buttons, LEDs
  - LCD
  - Robot

Does anyone remember what embedded systems were?  You're familiar with general-purpose computers - devices that are designed to be flexible and accommodate a wide range of needs.

Embedded systems are different - they're built to interact with the real-world and perform very specific functions, often with difficult constraints (timing, power, etc).  These are the systems that monitor the engine temperature in your car, power your digital watch, the brains of your microwave, etc.  Or perform functions in manufacturing lines, power plants or water treatment facilities.

Last semester 

Just like last semester, I think that this area of computing is going to be a big part of the future!


Did anyone do the reading for today?!  Readings / Assignments in the lesson notes on the course website.
